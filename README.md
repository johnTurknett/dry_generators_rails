# Dry Generators Rails
Dry Generator Rails brings dry-rb to Rails in a consistent 
manner.

This is a work in progress by a squishy human that makes mistakes and will 
eventually die.

## Available Generators

- dry:validation
- dry:struct
- dry:monad

## Usage
`rails g dry:validation User`

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry_generators_rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install dry_generators_rails
```

## Contributing
I would love any help you want to put towards this.

Bug reports and feature requests are also a form of help.

## License
